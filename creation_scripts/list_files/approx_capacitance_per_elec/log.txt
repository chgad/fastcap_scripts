Purpose:
The idea behind this is that by starting with a structure of (all-in-all) 3 electrodes,
 simulate/discretize it till convergence, we can divide the result by the number of electrode pairs and retrieve
the capacitance per electrode pair.
By then increasing the elctrode count we should, best case, see a kind of convergence for this value.
The reason for this hypothesis is that by increasing the structure the influence of the boundary electrodes gets smaller
and hence the capacitance per electrode pair should converge.

With a possible result we are able to give a pretty good estimate for the actual capacitance of the real structure.



State of the art 01.03.2019:

It seems evident that the dimensinality (length to width) of the structure plays a big role in the accomplishment of
convergence. Due to this fact the idea rises to repeat the same process first for electrode_length and then (or simultaniously)
with electrode length.

These results, for the electrode length influence on the capacity, are stored in "results_elec_length_increase" directory.
