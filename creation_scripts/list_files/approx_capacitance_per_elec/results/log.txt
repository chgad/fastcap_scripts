This is a log for the result files of the structures.

Structure parameter which do not change are :

    idt_height = 0.11

    elec_length = 139
    elec_width = 1.35
    elec_sep = 1.65

    base_length = 20.41

    substrate_width = 1.25 * si_o2_width
    substrate_length = 1.25 * si_o2_length
    si_o2_height = 2
    min_value = idt_height

The electrode count (overall count) is indicated in the File name which looks like:

File_base_name: approx_cap_per_elec_countXX.txt

We further document how many subdivides are needed till convergence is met.

File: approx_cap_per_elec_count03.txt
